# Anki-get-vocabulary
Script that takes words in a file and searches correspondent translation for the anki deck. 

## What is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)?
**Anki** is a SRS (Spaced Repetition Study) program that helps with the memorization of anything. In this case we are using Anki for
memorizing french vocabulary.

The ideia of SRS is that when you're about to forget for example the french word for "chest", you are reminded of that "potrine" is the way you say it. 

For my deck, I wanted the following elements in the card:
- English Word
- French Word
  - When feminine and masculin exists, show both
- IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
- Image
- Sound

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
